# README for mern-be

## Introduction
Welcome to the mern-be app! This app is a basic example of integrating MongoDB with a React application, using Express.js as the server framework.

## Prerequisites
Before you start, you need to have Node.js and Git installed on your system. If you don't have them installed, follow the instructions below to install them.

### Installing Node.js
1. Visit [Node.js Official Website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
4. To check if the installation was successful, open a terminal and run `node -v`. You should see the Node.js version number.

### Installing Git
1. Visit [Git Official Website](https://git-scm.com/).
2. Download the installer for your operating system.
3. Run the installer and follow the instructions to complete the installation.
4. To verify installation, open a terminal and run `git --version`. You should see the Git version number.

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**
   - Open a terminal.
   - Navigate into the directory you want to download the codebase into by running `cd <path to your directory>`.
   - Run `git clone https://github.com/avianleung/MERN-BE.git` to clone the repository.
   - Navigate into the cloned directory by running `cd mern-be`.

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - Inside the mern-be directory, run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.

## Running the Server
- Run `npm start` to start the server.
- The server will start with `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server if you make any changes to the source code.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure MongoDB is installed and running on your system. If not, visit [MongoDB Official Website](https://www.mongodb.com/) for installation instructions.
- The current codebase doesn't need MongoDB installed, but new changes will be pushed for additional examples requiring it.
